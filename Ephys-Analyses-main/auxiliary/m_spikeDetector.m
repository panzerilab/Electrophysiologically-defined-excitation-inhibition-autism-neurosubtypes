function [spkTimes, spkIndex, spkShape, threshold] = m_spikeDetector(MUA, fsMUA, method, th, nPoints)
% M_SPIKEDETECTOR Detect and extract spike waveform from MUA signal.
% Detection method is based on threshold which can be given from the
% experimentalist or predefined by the script itself.
% DEFAULT TH: 'median'. Another option: 'std'
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Pipeline:
% - Define th
% - Find spikes over th
% - Find the highest peak of the spike
% - Export the spikes shapes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% INPUT:
%   MUA : Multi unit activity
%   fsMUA : (optional) MUA sampling frequency. DEFAULT: 4000 Hz 
%   nPoints: (optional) number points for spike extraction. DEFAULT: 41 points
%   method : (optional) how to determine the threshold. 
%               option: 'median', '5std'. DEFAULT: 'median'
%   th : (optional) threshold to utilize for the detection 
%   
% OUTPUT:
%   spkTimes : spike position in second
%   spkIndex : spike position in index
%   spkShape : spike shape
%   threshold : used threshold

%   v1.2 17/12/2019 FR: Bug in the export of shapes
%   v1.1 24/06/2019 FR: Bug about external th corrected
%   v1.0 15/05/2019 FR: function created
